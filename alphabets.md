# Alphabets dataset

Researchers wanted to understand which mobile pen-based alphabets (writing systems) was most efficient. Participants used a pen-based stroke alphabet to enter a set of text phrases using one of three different alphabets. WPM = Words per minute.

- How many participants?
- How many different stroke alphabets?
- Is this between-subjects or within-subjects?
- How many factors? How many levels per factor?
- What is the measure?
- How do the distributions compare across levels?
- Is there a statistically significant difference in the means?
- What test would you use? Is it valid? Why or why not?
